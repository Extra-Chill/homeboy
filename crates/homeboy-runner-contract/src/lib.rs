//! Shared runner contract: behavior-free types and env-var constants that both
//! `homeboy-core` and the optional `homeboy-runner` feature crate depend on.
//!
//! Runner is an optional Lab-offload feature; core must not depend on runner
//! *behavior*. But some core code legitimately needs to name runner *concepts*
//! (e.g. the runner kind, or the env-var markers used when an exec crosses a
//! remote-runner boundary). Those plain-data contracts live here so core can
//! reference them without a `core -> runner` edge.
